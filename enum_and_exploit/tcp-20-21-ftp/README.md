```

## Connecting to and enumerating an FTP server
- Connect to the FTP server:
```bash
ftp <ip> # Try common creds: anonymous:, anonymous:anonymous, ftp:ftp
```
- Bypass a firewall:
```bash

```
- Enumerate files and folders:
```bash
ls -a # Always list hidden files as well
cd <path>

binary # To download binary files
ascii

get <filename>
```
